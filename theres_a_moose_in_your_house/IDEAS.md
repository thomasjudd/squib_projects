theres a moose in your house
a reworking of the terrible original game 

moose cards
house cards

players take turns being the moose
one player is the moose the rest of the players are the residents

the moose player has a hand of cards and puts one card in each residents house

game loop:

moose gets informed what rooms/game states score him bonuses
the residents receive some of that information
the moose places his moose card along with any moose decoys face down
the residents try to figure out where the moose is
if the moose player doesnt like where the discussion is going they may move a card closer towards the kitchen room

the moose player draws tomorrows "news bulletin" card which says what the moose gets bonus points for
the moose chooses where to
news bulletin: give some information to the residents about where the moose might be



residents houses

how do bluffing games work?

the players have hidden information

when all the information is revealed there is a concrete game state evaluation that determines the outcome given certain cards

before all information is revealed players may take actions
  - these actions must have a loose connection to improving the game state for any given players hidden information


structure level:

objectives: be in x room for y hours

moose turn:
simultaneous room selection

moose player chooses rooms to invade and resident chooses rooms to check
any moose that are caught go into the residents pile
other moose and decoy move into the rooms

then there needs to be a push your luck element
moose player chooses to reveal a piece of information regarding their objective in order to move
after the moose player takes the action the resident may check a room

place moose outside the window of each
