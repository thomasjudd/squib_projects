# Playtest Report Survey

## Basic Info
  2 players
  played for about 5 minutes
  taught from memory


## Did it work?
  letters cards are too constraining, many times the player had no card to play that would advance them towards the objective
  having players build words off of each others cards alleviate the constraint enough

## Was it fun?
  the game feels like it has potential to be fun, I worry that building the same "spell"(word) together takes away from the individuals feeling of casting spells
  another theme idea that would work the same is guessing the names of all of rumplestilkskins family members before they take your kidnap your children

## Proposed/Potential Improvements
  the players felt constrained by the hand of cards they each had to work with
  this is broken and can be fixed in a few ways
    1.) slow down the movement speed of the enemies, increase the rate at which enemies appear
    2.) add mechanisms to the cards to give the players something useful to do with their hand when they cant contribute to killing any of the enemies
    3.) increase the number of letters on each card to six, to increase the likelihood that players hands will be useful

  I think the best course of action would be add mechanisms to the cards as well as adding more letters to the cards
